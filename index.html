          <h3>Speed by Design &mdash; Keep The Mobile Web Quick</h3>
          <p>As attention spans are heading towards zero and more and more of the population is constantly on-the-go, optimizing your mobile websites to load quickly and efficiently can make an enormous difference in visitor engagement, and most importantly, your bottom-line. Designing for performance should be a top-priority in keeping your visitors happy and allowing them do what they need to do quickly.</p>
          <p>You&#8217;ll learn a few techniques on how to keep your mobile websites lean and loading quickly, how page speed is actually a component of good UX, how to test and benchmark under various network conditions, and how slow loading times can turn away visitors and potential paying customers.</p>

Writing code is the easy part, finding a modular practice and structure that works well across the board is the hard part.
